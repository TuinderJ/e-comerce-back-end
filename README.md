# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This is a back end for an e-commerce website that can read, store and update products, tags and categories.

- My motivation for building this app was to offer a simple api for an e-commerce website to use.
- I built this project to gain experience with express routing and mysql databases.
- This solves the problem of having to manage products manually and allows for future expansion of the store.
- I learned how using async await can simplify your code.
